## Design

### Colour Scheme

As the pages of the site have a background image, I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site quite small so as to not overwhelm users. Black and Grey  are very typical colours in super-expensive Micheline-star Restaurants.

In my css file I have used variables to declare colours, and then used these throughout the css file. I was recently introduced to this method during a hackathon - it is a useful convention to use as it allows you to alter the colour throughout the website if you decide to update a colour, by changing the colour once in the variable.

* I have used `#2f3035` & `#0c0e0e` as the primary and secondary colours used for the background.
* I have used `#383a3d` as the overlay used over the sites and for navigation bar.
* I have used `#101211` for the partial design.
* I have used `#202226` for the partial design

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font [Arial]('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Agbalumo&family=MedievalSharp&display=swap'). Arial and Agbalumo is based on a calligraphy style and I have chosen it as it looks like the type of font you would see on a Restaurant site, slightly medieval looking and grand.
