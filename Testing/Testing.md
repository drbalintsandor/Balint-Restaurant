Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

During development I made use of google developer tools to ensure everything was working correctly and to assist with troubleshooting when things were not working as expected.

I have gone through each page using google chrome developer tools & Firefox inspector tool to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.
